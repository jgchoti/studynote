## What is Agile?

### Agile Development Overview

- Dynamic approach to software development.
- Contrasts traditional methodologies like waterfall
- Key features include flexibility, customer involvement, and adaptability.
- Customer-centric and iterative process.

### Driven by User Personas and Stories

- Focus on meeting customer needs throughout the development lifecycle.
- User personas and stories guide the development process.
- Iterative nature allows for continuous adjustments based on feedback
  and changing requirements

### Best Practices and Organizational Clarity

#### Naming Conventions

- **Naming conventions** play a crucial role in maintaining organizational
  clarity within an
  Agile development environment.
- Whether using **camel case,
  snake case, kebab case, or pascal case,** consistent and
  clear naming
  conventions contribute to effective communication and collaboration.

ðŸ’¡ **camelCase** : JavaScript Variables and Function Names:

ðŸ’¡ **snake_case**: File Names (for Python or Server-Side JavaScript/Node.js):

> hack_your_future

ðŸ’¡ **kebab-case**: file, folder, branches'names and CSS/IDs Classes

> hack-your-future

#### Branch Names

- **Branch names** are structured according to established practices, such as indicating
  the type of work or feature in the branch.
- This ensures that each branch corresponds to a specific task or user story, facilitating
  efficient tracking and collaboration among team members.

### Continuous Feedback and Reflection

Agile development places a strong emphasis on continuous feedback and reflection.

#### Stand-up Meetings

- Daily stand-up meetings provide a platform for team members to share updates
  on their tasks,
  discuss challenges,
  and coordinate efforts.
- This regular communication fosters a collaborative environment and ensures
  that everyone is on
  the same page.

#### Retrospectives

- Retrospectives at the end of each sprint offer an opportunity
  for the team to reflect on what
  went well, what could be improved, and lessons learned.
- This reflective approach contributes to an iterative and improvement-focused development
  cycle, aligning with the Agile principles of responding to change
  and continuous delivery.
