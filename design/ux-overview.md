# UX Overview

## Definition of UX

- Identified various touchpoints in the user journey, from purchase to setup.
- Encompasses everything that influences a user's interaction with a product.
- Extends beyond the product itself, including the buying process, packaging,
and even discussions about the product.
- Originally termed "user experience architects" at Apple.

## UX Enhancement at Apple

- Aimed at improving an already good product.
- Focused on refining the overall user journey, making it more seamless and enjoyable.

## Misuse of the Term

- Currently, the term "user experience" is frequently misused.
- Some claim to be UX professionals without
understanding the holistic nature of the concept.
- Mistakenly narrowed down to designing websites or apps
without considering the broader context.

## Holistic Nature of UX

- Involves the entire user's perception and interaction with the world.
- Extends beyond individual products to encompass life
experiences, services, and systems.

## Key Takeaway

- UX is not limited to designing a specific device, website, or app.
- It is a comprehensive concept, encapsulating all aspects of
how users perceive and engage with products, services, and systems.

## Bad UX

- Frustration, confused navigation, poor readability, unresponsive design.
- Too many steps, confusing icons, lack of consistency.

## Importance of UX in Design and Development

- Increases user satisfaction, boosts engagement, improves retention and brand loyalty.
- Lowers development costs.

### Starting with Understanding User Needs

- User-centered design, focusing on users and tasks.
- Creation of primary and secondary personas to guide design decisions.
