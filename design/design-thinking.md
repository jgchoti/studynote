# Design Thinking Overview

- Solves real problems for a specific group of people.
- Taught in top design and business schools globally.
- Successful in bringing businesses happy customers and aiding entrepreneurs.

## Empathize (Step 1)

- Conduct **interviews** to understand people's concerns.
- Develop empathy for the situation.
- Uncover personal stories or challenging situations.
- Repeat the process with multiple individuals facing the same problem.

## Define the Problem (Step 2)

- Analyze interviews to identify actual needs.
- Underline verbs or activities related to the problem.
- **Formulate a problem** statement based on identified needs (e.g., elderly fear
loneliness, want to stay connected).

## Ideate (Step 3)

- Focus on the problem statement.
- Generate a variety of ideas, aiming for quantity.
- Examples include virtual reality experiences, senior-friendly hoverboards,
or modified pushcarts.
- Sketch and **present ideas to the target audience for feedback.**

## Prototype (Step 4)

- Reflect on feedback and learning from conversations.
- Combine new ideas with existing solutions.
- **Create a tangible prototype** that is just good enough to be tested.

## Test (Step 5)

- **Test the prototype** with actual users.
- Be open to feedback and avoid defending the idea.
- Learn from what works and what doesn't.
- Iterate through ideation or prototyping based on feedback.
- Repeat the process until a functional prototype effectively solves the
identified problem.

## Impact

- Achieve a prototype that works and solves the real problem.
- Positioned to make a positive impact and "change the world."
