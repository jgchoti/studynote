# UX vs. UI

## User Experience (UX)

- Involves everything users do with a company's stuff.
- Figures out and designs solutions that make users happy across different things.
- Teams from different areas (like Engineering, marketing, design) work together.

## User Interface (UI)

- Is about the things users directly touch or see on a screen.
- Makes digital stuff look good, with things like colors, buttons, and spacing.

## UX vs. UI Analogy

- UX is like the whole cake, representing the main user experience.
- UI is like the icing on the cake, making things look and feel good.
- Good UX is like a tasty cake, meeting expectations and making users happy.

## UX and UI Collaboration

- UX and UI work together closely.
- UX focuses on **understanding users and creating plans.**
- UI focuses on **making things look nice with layouts and designs.**
- Think of it like a cake needing both the cake part and the icing to be good.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Definition|Comprehensive user interaction| Specific visual touchpoints and cosmetics|
| Scope         | Entire user journey  | Visual and interactive components|
| Collaboration| Cross-disciplinary collaboration|Focused on design and visual aesthetics|
| Analogy | Entire cake (core experience)| Cake's icing (look, feel, presentation)|
|Collaboration Flow|UX research, task flows,prototypes|UI layouts,visual system,mock-ups|

In summary, UX and UI work hand in hand, with UX covering the overall user
experience and UI focusing on the visual and interactive parts of digital products.
