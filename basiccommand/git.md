# Guide to using git and GitHub

## <details><summary>GitHub and Committing Changes</summary>

When you commit changes in Git, it's like saving your game. But to share it or collaborate with others, you use a website called [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

**Create Repository (Folder)**: Before saving your work, create a new space on GitHub called a repository. Think of it like a folder for your project.

**Commit Changes (Save Game)**: Make changes to your project, and when you're ready to save them, commit those changes. It's like saving your game progress.

**Push to GitHub (Share your Saved Game)**: To share your progress with others or save it online, you push (upload) your committed changes to GitHub. This way, others can see what you've done, and you have a backup online.

In short, GitHub is where you store your project, commit is like saving changes, and pushing is like sharing or backing up your work online. ðŸš€
