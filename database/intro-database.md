- Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the relational model.
  - Tables: Sets of named relations or tables.
    - Each table has a unique name.
    - Contains attributes (columns) with constraints to ensure data integrity.
  - Record: A line of relation or a row in the table.
    - Contains values for each column.
    - Each column has a specific data type.
