# Basic SQL

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a special-purpose language
used to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL allows users to:

- Interact with existing databases.
- Execute queries to gather insights from the data.
- Define the structure of the data using schemas.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases use tables of data related by common fields (relationships).

- **Tables:** Names should be lowercase, use underscores instead of spaces, and can be collective or plural.
- **Fields:** Columns in a table.
  - Names should be lowercase, without spaces, and singular.
- **Unique Identifier:** A value that distinguishes a record from others in the same table.
- **Schema:** A design blueprint of the database showing tables and their relationships.
- **Row:** Represents a single entity.
- **Column:** Represents an attribute of the entity.
