# Full Stack Development Study Note ðŸ“š

Welcome to my study note, where I've documented everything I've learned during my training with [Hack Your Future Belgium](https://github.com/HYF-Class22). This serves as both a personal reference and a valuable resource for anyone interested in Full Stack Development.

## Purpose of This Note

1. **Personal Reference:** This document is crafted to deepen my understanding of Full Stack Development concepts, languages, and frameworks.

2. **Future Resource:** It acts as a go-to resource for "me" in the future, serving as a quick reference guide for various topics.

## Disclaimer

I want to emphasize that while I've put effort into compiling accurate information, I **cannot** guarantee the correctness of this note. It's always recommended to **cross-check** and **verify** information using reliable sources.
