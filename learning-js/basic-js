# Into Programming

### Basics of Code
- **Code:** Special instructions for computers.
- **Computer Language:** Set of rules defining valid instructions (*syntax*).
- **Statements:** Groups of words, numbers, and operators performing specific tasks.

### Variables and Expressions
- **Variables:** Symbolic placeholders for values.
- **Expressions:** Combinations of variables, literals, and operators.
- **Operators:** Symbols like `=`, `*` for operations.

### Program Execution
- Programs can be interpreted (line by line) or compiled (ahead of time). JavaScript typically compiles.

### Output
- `console.log(b);` prints `b` value to the console.
- `alert(b);` shows a pop-up alert with `b` value.

### Input
- `age = prompt("Please tell me your age:");` captures user input.

### Operators
- Arithmetic, increment/decrement, equality, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

### Values and Types
- Primitive values are built-in types in JavaScript.

### Converting Between Types
- Explicit and implicit coercion.
- Example: Using `==` converts the left-hand side from string to number for comparison.

### Code Comments
- Guidelines for effective comments.
- `//` for one-line comments and `/* .. */` for multiline comments in JavaScript.

### Variables
- Dynamic typing in JavaScript allows variables to hold any type.
- Constants are variables with values that don't change.
- Constants are often capitalized with underscores between words.

### Blocks
- JavaScript uses `{ .. }` for blocks.

### Conditionals
- `if` statements for conditional execution.

### Loops
- Iterations using `while` and `do..while` loops.
- Iterations typically start from `0` in programming languages.

### Functions
- Functions take arguments and can return values.

### Scope
- Lexical scope determines variable accessibility within functions.

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to programming concepts, JavaScript syntax, and fundamental constructs. It covers variables, expressions, operators, control flow, functions, and more, laying a strong foundation for readers new to programming or JavaScript.
